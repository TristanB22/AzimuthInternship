# More Code... More Problems

__This repository compiles all of the code which I wrote during my internship in the Azimuth Corporation's AAIM Lab. All of the code is mine outside of two folders --
Mr_Crutcher_Code (located in /MrCrutcherProjects/LicensePlateProject/) and Dr_Lucking_Code (located in /DrLuckingProjects/).__

__I would sincerely like to thank Mr. Crutcher, Dr. Lucking, Dr. Rice, and Mr. Nelson for their help during my internship. I would also like to extend my gratitude to the entire Azimuth Corproation for taking a chance on a highschool student and allowing me to intern at the company. This has been an incredibly eye-opening
experience and I am glad that I was able to provide value to the organization.__
